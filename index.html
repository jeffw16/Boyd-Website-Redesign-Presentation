						<aside class="notes">
							<p>For the past 10 years, McKinney Boyd High School has had the same website, dedicated to providing students, parents, and teachers access to information and resources. Raise your hand if you’ve used it.</p>
							<p>Over time, this website has become outdated and slow. As part of the 10 year anniversary, we have decided that it’s time to completely overhaul the website and rebuild it from scratch, improving the speed, quality, and design.</p>
							<p>We’d love to show it to you now.</p>

						<h2>So&hellip; here it is!</h2>
						<iframe class="fragment" width="100%" height="600px" src="https://jeffw16.github.io/Boyd-Website-Redesign/index.html"></iframe>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>It is with great pride that the new website was built completely by Computer Science 3 students. We designed and built the website with modern standards, and the usability that comes with it. My goal was to combine elegant designs with maximum usability. A fatal flaw of our old website was the lack of any optimization for mobile devicecs, however now, our website is responsive to your device’s screen size.</p>
							<p>We used contrasting colors on the Bronco color palate and intuitive organization to showcase important elements on the page, so that the users can easily locate each feature our development team has implemented.</p>
							<p>For example, all of our resources have been combined into one central location for students, teachers, and parents to access when they need to, and we’ve added “Quick Links” to the navigation bar so you can access things like the APG, Canvas, HAC, Destiny, Naviance, and of course, the McKinney ISD website.</p>
							<p>My favorite design idea was brought about by the diffuctly many parents had with the current faculty and staff pages. Our lead designer Justin Potts will later show you how we completely renovated how users look for teachers.</p>
							<p>For now, I’d love to bring out Jarod Norwood to talk a little bit about some new features we think you’ll love.</p>
							<p>My name is Jarod Norwood. I am a contributor for the project. I’m going to talk a little bit about some new features we’ve added as part of the redesign.</p>
							<p>The first one is one of the first things you’ll see on the RSS feed. This allows you to see upcoming events and Boyd Spur headlines directly as they’re published, without having to visit two websites for information.</p>

						<h2>Resources</h2>
						<iframe class="fragment" width="100%" height="600px" src="https://jeffw16.github.io/Boyd-Website-Redesign/resources.html"></iframe>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Parents want resources, and we want to make that easier with the new website. All of our resources have been combined into one central location for students, teachers, and parents to access when they need to, and we’ve added “Quick Links” to the navigation bar so you can access things like the APG, Canvas, HAC, Destiny, Naviance, and of course, the McKinney ISD website.</p>
							<p>Don't know what you want? There's a search bar on every page now.</p>

						<h2>Bell schedule</h2>
						<iframe class="fragment" width="100%" height="600px" src="https://jeffw16.github.io/Boyd-Website-Redesign/bellschedule.html"></iframe>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>We also updated the bell schedule for regular days...</p>
						</aside>

					<section>
						<h2>Testing schedule</h2>
						<iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://jeffw16.github.io/Boyd-Website-Redesign/bellschedule.html"></iframe>
						<p class="fragment">(Thanks Bora Gomez!)</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>...and finals week, making it easier to show where you’re supposed to be and when.</p>
							<p>We’ll now have Justin Potts explain some more features.</p>
						</aside>

					<section>
						<h2>News</h2>
						<iframe class="fragment" width="100%" height="600px" src="https://jeffw16.github.io/Boyd-Website-Redesign/news.html"></iframe>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>My name is Justin Potts, and I am the Lead Developer for this project. We’ve also added the RSS feature to the news page, where we showcase updates, news, and tweets from the Boyd Twitter account, as well as Dr. Peirson.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Bronco Beat</h2>
						<iframe class="fragment" width="100%" height="600px" src="https://jeffw16.github.io/Boyd-Website-Redesign/broncobeat.html"></iframe>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>To access the Bronco Beat, you can visit this page and view the newsletter directly in your browser, without having to download a file every time.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>New faculty directory</h2>
						<iframe class="fragment" width="100%" height="600px" src="https://jeffw16.github.io/Boyd-Website-Redesign/faculty.html"></iframe>
						<p class="fragment">(Thanks Jeffrey Wang, Andrew Oakes, Scott McFarlane, Marvin Fuxa!)</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>One of my favorite new features to the site is the addition of searching for faculty. No more looking through an endless list of names you don’t recognize, until you find your teacher, only to have trouble reading their information. We’ve completely redesigned the process to make it easier for you to find the information you need.</p>
							<p>As you saw in the video, if I type in a search query, it immediately suggests teachers' names, even if it's a partial match. Then, if I click on their name, it jumps directly to all of their information.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Senior info</h2>
						<iframe class="fragment" width="100%" height="600px" src="https://jeffw16.github.io/Boyd-Website-Redesign/seniorinfo.html"></iframe>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>It's important to put information on the new Boyd website in a centralized place for our major events. For example, you can now use our "Senior info" page to check out the details about prom, graduation, and other senior events on the senior calendar.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>About us</h2>
						<iframe class="fragment" width="100%" height="600px" src="https://jeffw16.github.io/Boyd-Website-Redesign/about.html"></iframe>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>And finally, we have a new "About us" page. We plan to add everything important and special about McKinney Boyd High School on here. If you have any suggestions, please tell us! I'll now turn it over to Nicholas Roth to finish the presentation off.</p>

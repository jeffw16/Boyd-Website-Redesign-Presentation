						<p>For the past 10 years, McKinney Boyd High School has had the same website, dedicated to providing students, parents, and teachers access to information and resources. Raise your hand if you’ve used it.</p>
						<p>Over time, this website has become outdated and slow. As part of the 10 year anniversary, we have decided that it’s time to completely overhaul the website and rebuild it from scratch, improving the speed, quality, and design.</p>
						<p>We’d love to show it to you now.</p>

						<p>It is with great pride for me to say that the new website was built completely by Computer Science 3 students. We designed and built the website with modern standards, and the usability that comes with it. My goal as Lead Designer was to combine elegant designs with maximum usability. Something missing from our old website was a mobile version for smartphones and tablets, making it difficult to view important information; however now, our website is responsive to your device’s screen size.</p>
 						<p>We used contrasting colors on the Bronco color palate and intuitive organization to showcase important elements on the page, so that the users can easily locate each feature our development team has implemented.</p>
 						<p>For example, all of our resources have been combined into one central location for students, teachers, and parents to access when they need to, and we’ve added “Quick Links” to the navigation bar so you can access things like the APG, Canvas, HAC, Destiny, Naviance, and of course, the McKinney ISD website.</p>
 						<p>My favorite design idea was brought about by the difficulty many parents had with the current faculty and staff pages. Our lead designer Justin Potts will later show you how we completely renovated how users look for teachers.</p>
						<p>But now, I’d love to bring out Jarod Norwood to talk a little bit about some new features we think you’ll love.</p>
